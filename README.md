# FoxSQL
This project was created in 2018 when I was struggling with remote access to the database issues with my iPad. So I created this product, purely based on my own needs. In 2019, I decided to publish this product on the AppStore. However, after several releases, I abandoned this project just because I started my study of a Master degree since 2020. Now I decided to opensource this product. It supports MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL.

This project relies on a mariadb connector which you can find [here](https://github.com/zachgenius/mariadb-connector-c-ios-macos). I think I will not maintain this project in a mid-term period. So, use it on your own risk :)
